# General instructions:

There are 2 options to build the test in. You can select Option A or Option B, you do not need to carry out both tests.

Choose the one you prefer. [Click to visit site with test](https://johannrp27.github.io/test-dd/)

#### Option A
HTML/CSS
- Replicate the section above utilizing grid and flex, depending on whatâ€™s best for each case and using 7 items in total: 4 on the first row and 3 on the second row (aligned left).
- Responsiveness: When necessary, add a breakpoint to switch to 2 or 1 items per row.

JS
- In a separate folder, duplicate the files and add buttons outside of the grid.
- Choose option a or b for the buttons (you do not need to code both):
  - a) Make the buttons swap the colors and headlines of each product on click
  - **b) Make the buttons remove or add items to the grid on click.**
- Use only Vanilla JS.

#### Option B

**REACT**

- Build the section above with React
- Add an input field that can be used to edit the product titles (the titles should change live while typing)
- Add a range to edit the font-size of the product titles
- Outside of the grid display the total sum of the product quantities that come from the inputs in each of them.
